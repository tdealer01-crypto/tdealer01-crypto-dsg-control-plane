## Trinity AI Multi-Agent System

Dashboard: `/dashboard/trinity`

A 5-agent orchestration system for AI job discovery and governed execution, built on DSG governance infrastructure.

### Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Mind** | Job discovery — fetches live bounties from GitHub + Immunefi |
| **Hand** | Execution — generates deliverables per job category (8 templates) |
| **Eye** | Verification — quality scoring with configurable threshold (≥70) |
| **Nerve** | Reputation — updates agent tier based on execution outcomes |
| **Spine** | Governance — DSG policy gate (5 constraints) before any execution |

### Governance Constraints

All executions are gated by 5 Spine policy constraints:

1. Agent Active (reputation ≥ 0)
2. Job Amount Valid (0 < reward < 100,000)
3. Deadline Valid (deadline in future)
4. Agent Qualified (skills.length > 0)
5. No Sanctions (reputation ≥ 0)

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET  /api/trinity/discover` | Live job discovery (GitHub bounties + Immunefi) with demo fallback |
| `POST /api/trinity/orchestrate` | Full governance → execution → verification cycle (dry_run default) |
| `POST /api/trinity/execute-job` | Execute specific job with Supabase write-back |
| `GET  /api/trinity/history` | Execution history + agent profile from Supabase |

### Key Design Rules

- `dry_run=true` is the default — no real SOL transfers without explicit `dry_run: false`
- `UNSUPPORTED` governance outcome never becomes `PASS`
- All executions produce `planHash`, `proofHash`, and `auditHash` (SHA-256)
- Tier progression: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum based on reputation + completed jobs
- Immunefi and GitHub bounties are live when API keys are present; falls back to 8 demo listings
- Supabase persistence: `agent_profiles` + `job_executions` tables (written only when `dry_run=false`)
